# Slideshow

The `src` folder contains the source code of the JavaScript slideshow,
which consists of a sequence of images that move forwards and backwards.
In the mobile version of the slideshow the animation is simpler, with
only one image visible at a time.

## Perspective customization

The perspective of the slideshow can be changed by clicking on the customize button in the bottom-right corner.
It opens a panel with a lateral view of the cards profiles (the five blue lines on the left) and the position of the point of view (the dot on the right).
Both the cards profiles and the point of view can be dragged to change the perspective. It can also be selected a mode with only the cards borders visible
in order to better see the position of each card.

## Live version
