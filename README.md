# Slideshow

The `slideshow` folder contains the source code of the JavaScript slideshow.

# Perspective tool

The `perspective` folder contains the code of a web page that can be used to try
different perspectives changing the distance and the height of the point of view.
Developer tools of the browser can then be used to find the values of width, height
and translateY properties of each card that are used in `slideshow/style.css`.
